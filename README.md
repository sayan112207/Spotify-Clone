# Spotify-Clone
It is a basic clone website of Spotify.

It perfomrs various operations such as Play, Pause, Next, Previous along with the a functional seek bar.

All the songs and images must be stored in your directory.

For this project I have used No Copyright Sounds(NCS) Songs and the album covers as well.

The languages used for this project is HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
